# Learning to Guide: Guidance Law Based on Deep Meta-learning and Model Predictive Path Integral Control

### About


This work aims at implementing Model-based Deep Reinforcement Learning with Model Predictive Path Integral controller for the **missile** guidance problem as described in our paper
**Learning to Guide: Guidance Law Based on Deep Meta-learning and Model Predictive Path Integral Control.**
This IEEE Access paper is open access at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8682051 and also available on arXiv at https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06892


### Dependencies

This code has been tested on python and requires tensorflow-gpu & numpy installed.
This demonstrative run is built on the pre-trained guidance neural network model, the code, system model and training dataset of which will be posted afterwards if anybody asks.

### How to Run

Please use `mppi_run.py` to run.

Run can also be done using `monte_carlo_simu.sh` to do iteratively runs to get Monte Carlo sampling results. In the paper the results
of Monte Carlo simulation are collected using the get_Monte.m file of MATLAB.
